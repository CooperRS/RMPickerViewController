##Installation
###CocoaPods
```ruby
platform :ios, '7.0'
pod "RMPickerViewController", "~> 1.3.3"
```

###Manual
1. Check out the project
2. Add all files in `RMPickerViewController folder to Xcode

##Usage
###Basic
1. Import `RMPickerViewController.h` in your view controller
	
	```objc
	#import "RMPickerViewController.h"
	```
2. Implement the `RMPickerViewControllerDelegate` protocol
	
	```objc
	@interface YourViewController () <RMPickerViewControllerDelegate>
	@end
	```
	
	```objc
	#pragma mark - RMPickerViewController Delegates
	- (void)pickerViewController:(RMPickerViewController *)vc didSelectRows:(NSArray  *)selectedRows {
		//Do something
	}

	- (void)pickerViewControllerDidCancel:(RMPickerViewController *)vc {
		//Do something else
	}
	```
	
3. Open date selection view controller
	
	```objc
	- (IBAction)openSelectionController:(id)sender {
    	RMPickerViewController *pickerVC = [RMPickerViewController pickerController];
    	pickerVC.delegate = self;
    	
   		[pickerVC show];
	}
	```
	
4. Do not forget to implement `UIPickerViewDelegate` and `UIPickerViewDataSource` methods.

## Documentation
There is an additional documentation available provided by the CocoaPods team. Take a look at [cocoadocs.org](http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/RMPickerViewController/).

## Requirements
Works with:

* Xcode 6
* iOS 8 SDK
* ARC (You can turn it on and off on a per file basis)

iOS 8 SDK is only needed for compiling (as it uses the blur feature provided by iOS 8 SDK). At runtime the control only needs iOS 7 or later.

If you absolutely need to use iOS 7 SDK you can take a look at the iOS 7 branch called [1.2.x](https://github.com/CooperRS/RMPickerViewController/tree/1.2.x)
